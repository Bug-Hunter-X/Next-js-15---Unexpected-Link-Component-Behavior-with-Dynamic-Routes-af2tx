# Next.js 15 - Unexpected Link Component Behavior with Dynamic Routes

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in the Next.js 15 `Link` component when navigating between pages with dynamic routes using client-side routing.  The issue involves inconsistent route updates and content rendering.

## Bug Description
The `Link` component does not reliably update the route or render the appropriate content when using dynamic routes and client-side navigation. This leads to unexpected behavior and prevents seamless page transitions. 

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Observe unexpected rendering and navigation issues when using the Link component.

## Solution
Refer to bugSolution.js for an updated solution using `useRouter` for explicit route management and improving client-side navigation.
